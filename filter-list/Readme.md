Business use-case

	• Create  a filter view as listed above.
	• Ability to add or remove file. On adding a filter, the option should be removed from the custom filters option. 
    On clicking on remove, the custom filter should be added to the options list.
	• Clicking on apply would send all the applied filters to the consuming component.
      On clicking on cancel, the filter should be removed from the view.Filter list must be a list of group with each group containing 
    the title and list of options to it
